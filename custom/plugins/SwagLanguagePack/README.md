# SwagLanguagePack

## A unified language extension for [Shopware 6](https://github.com/shopware/shopware).

### Description

The path to internationalisation is an exciting one and requires quite a bit of work - everything needs to be set up
perfectly; from the currency to choosing the right shippingprovider and, of course, the right languages and so much
more. With the numerous extensions and interfaces available in the Community Store, you already have access to a large
selection and many options to help drive your internationalisation.

Shopware’s new language extension now quickly and easily provides you with an array of languages to choose from. This
way, you can set up your admin and/or storefront with different languages and take the next step towards
internationalisation with no trouble at all. With this extension you now have over 25 languages at your disposal in just
one extension. You no longer have to activate an extension for each language. One extension – many languages.

The following languages are already available (more to follow):
